IMPORTANT NOTES
Email addresses are public/verified as of January 2026 research

Zimbabwe context: Hyperinflation/currency challenges mean funding through international organizations is essential

UN coordination advantage: Single entry point (zimbabwe.un.org/en/contact-us) can route to all agencies

Local partner requirement: Many international orgs require local NGO co-implementation partner—Sibongile as founder may qualify or need local registration

Government relationships: World Bank & UNDP coordinate with GoZ (Government of Zimbabwe) ministries

Timing: UN system (UNDP/Spotlight) cycles are often annual—check current funding rounds
